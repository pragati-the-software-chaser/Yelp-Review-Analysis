       "  \"I LOVED this spot and would argue it's one of the best Korean fusion tapas I've had! We tried the edamame dumplings, steak, truffle mac & cheese, popcorn chicken, and cauliflower (in order of my favorites). They were all soo good but the edamame dumplings & steak stole the show! * Edamame dumplings- filled with a smooth & creamy edamame paste and topped with the perfect amount of truffle oil & Parmesan. So unique and delicious! My only complaint is I wish this plate came with more! We shared amongst 3 and got ~1 each* Steak- tender and cooked to perfection. Topped with a soy garlic glaze and coupled with grits-like feta cheese. Absolutely amazing * Truffle Mac & cheese - I loved that you can smell the truffle the minute they bring it by your table, they don't skimp on the truffle! This was delicious and creamy! (but definitely on the heavier side)* Korean popcorn chicken - pretty good and would have again (I love popcorn chicken), but nothing too special!* Cauliflower - spiced and seasoned, almost close to an Indian food-like flavoring. Good, but not amazing Overall, loved the food here! You can't go wrong with your choices. As our drink, we got the saki but I absolutely want to try the soju next time :)Also- great covid protocols. They took temps and our table was separated by curtains on each side (we sat inside). I recommend going early since they don't take reservations and there's always a wait!\",\n",
       "  \"I'll start with saying their outdoor seating is a true accomplishment in the era of Covid and outdoor dining especially in this biting December weather. The menu options were mostly between inspired and creative. Despite the lag of more traditional dishes this Asian fusion please completely nailed it in terms of execution. Their edamame dumplings were almost as good as buddakan (almost but not quiet). The clear star of the show was the black truffle mac & cheese. The soft shell crab with the wasabi REmoulade was extremely well executed. I also love the broccoli Rob with the Korean chili oil but had a tough time picking between this and the brussels sprouts which were dragon flamed and I will hence be back for soon. The angry sweet potato came with a delicious and generous side of sririacha cheese which I almost wanted to save for the future. I was seduced by the plantain because of its unique pairing with Lebanese condiments such as Lebneh. I will also be back for the eel tacos next time since my stomach surprisingly could not fit another thing by the time dinner was done. The final crowning Jewel on top of the adorable Decour in the comfortably warm seating was the desert which was conveniently not too sweet or heavy. It is definitely becoming an East Village new \\xa0favoriteP.s. I will say the kimchi paella was a bit underwhelming and the portions are on the small side\",\n",
       "  \"This NYC gem was just a magical birthday celebration evening. NYC opened indoor dining back up to 25% and as I write this, it is now at 35%. We cannot lose these places...this is what makes New York, New York. I hope that we can all get through this pandemic and keep these gems alive.As I was saying...You will not be disappointed at all! Every dish created by CHEF PROPRIETOR KAY HYUN & team was MAGICAL!The flavors, the combination, the textures. Beautiful tapas sized plates were shared amongst my group.It is an art and every bite should take you on a rollercoaster ride.My kids are 10 + 8 years old and I'm so grateful they were able to experience this journey through all the different plates. They loved it and had a better understanding of each one.\",\n",
       "  'Omg!! What a great meal from start to finish. I have been dying to try Thursday kitchen for the longest time. We came on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated immediately (IMO the best spot for outdoor dining). We decided to share as many dishes as we could and left feeling full and satisfied. We ordered: Edamame dumplings 8/10- overall flavor was delicious but texture a little mushy for my taste Steak 7/10- steak was a little tough but the flavors were excellent Truffle mac and cheese 10/10 *MUST ORDER* - everything you could ever want. That cheese pull though Kimchi paella 9/10 *MUST ORDER* - amazing mix of flavors and perfectly cooked seafood Gnocchi 6/10 - gnocchi had amazing texture but the sauce was a little too sweetDefinitely recommend checking Thursday Kitchen out for small but filling bites! Great place for catching up with friends or date night!',\n",
       "  \"We came on a Monday evening right when it opened. No wait and several tables remained available during the duration our dinner.Server suggested two dishes per person but we had more than that. The edamame dumplings were a standout. We've never had anything quite like it and they were cooked well. The batter that the soft shell crab was cooked in leaned sweet. It reminded me almost of the sweetness of funnel cake, which I personally enjoy. I just missed the actual flavor of the crab because all I could taste was the sweet batter. Kimchi paella was solid. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the lucky noodle dish but I enjoyed the chewiness of the torn noodles with the crispness of the vegetables. I can't handle a lot of spice and could easily eat both the kimchi paella and lucky noodles. Eel tacos were also made well, no complaints. Truffle mac and cheese was tasty. Steak was very flavorful and soft.I enjoyed trying yuzu beer for the first time as well. Worth checking out if the menu piques your interest. No high chairs were offered and there's no changing table in the restroom.\",\n",
       "  \"Came to Thursday Kitchen this evening for my birthday since this is my favorite restaurant. \\xa0Yet another great meal here. This time we tried the soupy and spicy Korean chili pepper gnocchi. My boyfriend got the kimchi paella which he said was really good. I always get the lucky noodle and the Korean popcorn chicken. \\xa0We also enjoyed the lettuce jem salad. Really you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu at this place. The drinks and service were also excellent as always. \\xa0Can't wait to be back again al summer\",\n",
       "  \"Great food and great service. Everything came out fast and the people that work there are really nice. We got the Korean popcorn chicken, lucky noodle, edamame dumplings and truffle Mac and cheese. My favorite were the lucky noodles. It was spicy but I prefer my food to be in the spicier side. The portions are meant to be small plate portions but they still are quite generous. Drinks are great as well. Can't wait to come back\",\n",
       "  \"My friend and I went on a Monday night and it was very busy. Luckily we were able to get seated immediately around 6:30 PM. We got the tuna tartar, plantains, truffle mac n cheese, soft shell crab katsu, kimchi paella, and bread pudding topped with blueberries. The plantains were definitely our favorite but of course we forgot to take a picture... the tuna tartar and bread pudding were also at the top of our list. Everything else was also really good but a bit too filling since the mac n cheese and paella were just carbs. Overall, I would suggest getting 5-6 items for 2 people if you're pretty hungry.\",\n",
       "  \"The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the extremely long wait time because there's no reservation system- but the food is amazing! There are so many reviews for this restaurant and the hype is understandable. We came at 7pm on a Friday, where the wait was 2.5 hours for 4 people. Luckily, our friends lived nearby so we killed the time at their place. When finally seated, every dish that was brought on was astonishing. The only thing is I wish the portions were bigger! At first look, the pricing looks quite decent but the dishes, since it's tapas style, are quite small especially when shared. I'd recommend coming here with a small party. The standout was the truffle Mac and cheese and eel taco personally. Just the perfect amount of truffle drizzled on the creamy Mac and cheese leaves you wanting so much more! The eel taco is quite unique, and the guac adds a light twist to what might be a heavy bite. Be prepared to wait if you come, but also be prepared to have an unforgettable meal.\",\n",
       "  \"Thursday Kitchen offers a unique menu of food and drinks in the setting of a warm and welcoming place. I came here on a, you guessed it, Thursday evening. We ordered the kimchi paella and truffle mac and cheese. If you're lactose intolerant, pack your pill because you're going to need it. These dishes were extra cheesy with the pull and all. True beauty. The flavors came through with each bite. I recommend these dishes. They are more filling than you think.The drinks come in plastic pouches. We got Lychee Reach Rich and Ruby the GF. Both delicious but do know that Ruby has rosé and not rose which I found out the fun way. The service here is wonderful. Our waitress was hilarious and made our dining experience memorable.\",\n",
       "  \"Was brought to this incredible spot by a friend, and I cannot wait to go back ASAP! We lined up a few minutes before they opened at 5PM on a Saturday night, and there was already quite a crowd. We got seated shortly, and ordered drinks, and two family-style dishes to share. The Plantains were out of this world, and the Korean Popcorn Chicken was absolutely incredible. One of the best meals I've had in a long time with great service too!! Highly recommend.\"],\n",

The decor of this spot is what I would call city rustic. Wood everywhere, but city slick. The staff was great... attentive and quick. I've been given those in the service industry all the praise. I can imagine how hard it's been working with limited resources,in a hot mask and gloves....and still have to deal with people who seem to have forgotten we're still in the middle of a pandemic. No, it's not as bad as it was before, but please give people in the service industry grace. Okay, I'm jumping off my soap box.The drink of choice for me was the Eastside. If you like gin cocktails, you'll love it. If not, try it anyway... lol. For food I had the breakfast club scrambler. It's usually made with egg whites, but I asked for the entire egg b/c I knew I needed more protein. My friend had the soul for real chicken and waffles. The chicken was a bit bland ( that's why only 4 ). The lack of flavor was sad, when the rest of the meal was really great. I do plan on checking this spot out for dinner. I'll be the one dancing in my seat :-)\",\n",
       "  'I just KNEW I would love this place. I have had this place saved in my folder for a while and had finally ventured over! I made a reservation before coming because this place fills up quickly (to COVID capacity of course because yes, they follow all guidelines). The people were so kind especially when I asked about their gluten free options. The chef got on the phone with me and explained all of their options. It\\'s rare you get customer service like that but it made me even more excited for the reservation. We got there and of course we were reminded of the 90 minute time limit, we were given a great booth with the tree and flowers encapsulating us. The waiter and waitress were so kind and patient because we had some people running late, I needed a new mask, we couldn\\'t decide on drinks and food. haha. We were a little all over the place.Food: EXCELLENT! I loveddddddd the bacon dates and still think about them. The french fries were amazing, they were kind of steak cut which is usually something I hate but they were seasoned excellently (truffle oil, people!). I also loved the Brussel sprouts. This place is perfect for people like me who like healthy food that is transformed into comfort food (hence the name). The rest of the table loved the fried chicken but of course, I couldn\\'t eat it since it\\'s not GF. Drinks: Oh my! We ordered the El Flamingo and it was perfect! It was definitely a \"pretty\" drink and was just light enough to make you smile but get you feeling \"good\". The El Flamingo actually complimented all of the food I ate as well and that\\'s rare for me to find which is why I usually drink water when I eat. Ambience: Super cute! Heavy on the wood accents which makes sense because of the name. The backyard seating was a little lackluster but did the job. The inside is what really sells this place. My regret was not getting the s\\'mores but that\\'s OK because it means I need to go back.',\n",
       "  'I came to the cabin for their weekend Throwback Brunch. We were seated in the back patio. They have a tent set up with some decor to make it look nice. I\\'d hope that once things get back to normal, they would really make that into a nice outdoor eating area. The tent was fine for the current situation. The music was good. They played mostly throwback r&b Jams and they had a separate speaker in the back patio. We ordered the 3 for $10 drinks. You had a choice of mimosas, screwdriver, Bloody Mary or a beer (I believe). \\xa0Note: you can only order that deal once. Lol. Anyways, I went with the mimosas and they were good. After I asked our waiter \"what were the favorites,\" I chose his recommendation for the Brunch Burger. It was delicious and I\\'d def order it again. Overall, it was a good experience and I\\'d definitely come back. The inside is very artsy and beautiful.',\n",
       "  'Great spot for some good cocktails! Came here on a busy day after indoor dining opened up. Managed getting late reservation. Unfortunately it is a hard for a girl to sit on the drum seats! Loved the indoor vibes, but just to be more comfortable we moved outdoors. The patio felt like a college frat party! \\xa0Indoors definitely had a classy vibe. This is a good spot for vegetarians! They are small plates but good portion. If you love a twist in mac and cheese, they do try that! I loved their Brussels sprouts and the \\xa0veggie burger. The burrata could have been better, or maybe I have high expectations. The host was very sweet and accommodating. Will definitely go back and enjoy some more drinks and enjoy the indoor dining vibe!',\n",

       "  \"So if I had to be honest I would give this place a 3.5.The out of 5 stars. Don't get me wrong the food was amazing and it was a cute spot in LES. Now, the portion sizes were extremely small and I know it's a taps bar but it comes off as more of a resturant based on the photos and menu I saw earlier throughout the day. The main reason I give it a lower rating is because the service was so RUSHED and ALMOST RUDE about ordering drinks. I totally understand that it's COVID times and we all need to make that money, but no where on my reservation or even check in time did I hear a word about a time limit. They also said we couldn't \\xa0sit and wait for the rest of our party at our table that was RESERVED FOR US BASED ON CAPACITY. Basically my boyfriend and I couldn't sit inside at the table we reserved for three while waiting on our third guest. Doesn't make any sense to me. Regardless I'm not gonna give them a bad rating , because it was a very vibrant place in LES that I would definitely want to try another time for brunch or an earlier menu. Their bacon wrapped dates were delicious and so were the Brussels sprouts! Just wish the portion sizes were bigger! The decorations were really cute and I feel like during a normal time in life the bar would be poppin!\",\n",

The tree right in the middle decorated with leaves did it for me too. I was impressed with the decor. I honestly wasn't crazy about the food. I enjoyed y brussel sprouts but I had the sugar on the side. It was a nice added touch but I wanted to be in control on home much I wanted on there. The shrimp was my favorite item on the menu. I took one bite out of the fried chicken and couldn't eat anymore. It didn't even look appetizing honestly. It was dry and lacked flavor. The meatballs weren't good either. The bread was good when dipped in the sauce the shrimp came in. Our drinks were ok.Overall I would return. Our waitress was friendly.\",\n",
       "  'The food here is honestly mediocre. Let me start with the good things. The ambiance is gorgeous. Love the tree in the middle and that nature-esque vibe. As my friend called it, it was \"London meets Montana\". Amazing music as well! As with the food, I went with a party of 4 and shared 4 items. We ordered the truffle fries which was amazing, the not so Caesar salad which was alright. The fried chicken was mediocre but the cole slaw was not it. The veggies didn\\'t compliment each other. We also ordered the s\\'mores which was a bit disappointing in my opinion. However the biggest disappointment was the portion sizes. Again, we were encouraged to share but the portions were just sadly tiny. For $12, I\\'d love more fries. The $17 fried chicken for 2 Small pieces was not worth it at all. All and all, the food is here is wayyy overpriced for the portion you are getting which is really sad because I really wanted to like this place. I\\'ve been here for brunch prior which the food wasn\\'t great in my opinion. The drinks were not bad!',\n",

They have outdoor seating in their backyard- it's covered and they have fall themed decorations throughout the restaurant and it's cute. They have a drinks special during brunch where you get 3 drinks ( choice of Bloody Mary, mimosa, screwdriver, a local ale) for $10 - fantastic deal and the drinks are pretty strong. The food is fine- nothing exceptional but not bad either. They're served in to-go containers with plastic cutlery. Another thing to mention- we were here at noon for brunch and the restaurant was out of coffee!The restaurant is very cognizant of social distancing and enforce it, check your temperature before you get seated, take down contact information for contact tracing and the staff wears masks at all times.

They had extremely high partitions between tables that were not spaced 6' apart (but otherwise social distancing was observed). Less than 25% of capacity was used indoors when we dined on Sat during brunch (outdoors was quite bustling).My husband and I shared our favorite menu items, including the chicken liver mousse (which was listed as a separate brunch special item - so don't be disappointed when you don't see it on the regular brunch menu online!), moules frites, and grilled octopus. The first two hadn't changed a bit, but the octopus was updated from a ratatouille base to a tabouleh, which I thought was a nice improvement.\",\n",

It\\'s an easy fallback because you can\\'t really go wrong with anything on the menu. I don\\'t usually go for the entrees, because I love sharing a bunch of small dishes among friends. My must-orders are the chicken liver mousse (super rich and creamy) and the moules frites. Their french fries are great and I love the dipping sauces! The mussel broth is also perfect for soaking up with bread. I also love the goat cheese ball, French onion soup, beef tartare... basically everything on the menu. The service is also extremely nice each time - once they forgot my add-on of truffles on my \"Gratin de Ravioles\" order (think elevated mac-and-cheese) and they brought out a generous serving of truffles, free of charge. Dinner gets a bit busy, but brunch is extremely easy to just walk in.',\n",
       "  \"My food friend was eyeing this place and I'm so glad we stopped by. At first I was thinking how does a French restaurant with wine have so many reviews in NY, but Amelie did not disappoint. We ordered the lobster risotto, duck leg confit, octopus and escargot. Plenty of food for 4 people. The risotto was great in texture and had a fair amount of labor. The duck was cooked perfectly. Crispy skin on the outside and fall off the bone meat on the inside. The grilled octopus and escargot are a must order as well. We also had some wine flights which were priced very nicely during happy hour even on a Sunday. Love how they have happy hour even on the weekends. The drink menu is extensive here. Highly recommend making reservations prior to dining here as the seats filled up very quickly. The restaurant ambience is great with all of the wine bottles along the wall. Amelie takes Covid seriously as the entire staff is wearing gloves and masks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you want great food, wine and a place to people watch as well\",\n",

This place is situated just a few blocks from Washington Square Park which I think is probably the best location for this restaurant. When you arrive at Amelie you will feel like you are back in arrondissement 7 or maybe even 9. The staff is awesome so attentive and helpful. The follow COVID rules and have heat lamps. We ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie board which was GENEROUS. It had a great balance of cheese and meats and guess what? They had GF CRACKERS FOR ME! They might of thought I was a little over the top with my one million \\'thank you\\'s\" but it is so hard to go to a restaurant and find GF crackers!!! I ordered the Steak Au Poivre which had sliced pieces of steak with sauce drizzled on top and a side of french fries and side salad. The steak was \\xa0cooked perfectly, not too chewy, and had the right amount of softness paired decently with the sauce. I thought it was going to be more of a Bolognese (please don\\'t ask me why I thought this lol) but it wasn\\'t and I\\'m happy it wasn\\'t.

There were 4 flights total with 3 tastings each but it's a blast. I would say each taste had about 2 oz and would be equivalent to a glass of wine.

Duck - Flavorful and tender. Good portion.3. Beef bourguignon - Plenty of sauce. Felt like needed more veggies alongside the meat though.

We were deciding between having it cooked medium rare or medium, and the waiter recommended medium.

They also brought over a folding tray stand (right next to our table) and told us they will serve our foods on that stand and when we are done to put the empty plates back on that stand.

The flavor was A+.Hens of the Wood ($22.00): roasted maitake mushroom, pickled honshimeji, parmesan, balsamic-soy reduction, chimichurri aioli. We really enjoyed this dish. Although the portion was on the smaller side and it was a bit too pricey. The highlight of this dish was definitely the chimichurri aioli. It paired perfectly with the mushroom.Striped Bass ($36.00): came with littleneck clams, toasted fregola, spicy tomato broth. WE ARE NOT A FAN. The bass was too fishy. I would not recommend this dish.Rotisserie Chicken ($29.00 - half): heritage bird, Jamaican jerk marinade, cornbread pudding, cabbage slaw, natural just. WOW, this chicken was so tender and meaty. It was not dry at all. The portion was just right for two people. I would recommend this!Service: it was really good overall. There is constantly someone checking up on us to refill our waters and ask how we are doing.One thing I want to point out was that there were no heating lamps and it can get chilly dining outdoors at night. COVID-related: -all tables were at least 6 feet apart-all employees wore a mask-temperature checks were administered upon check-in',\n",
       "  'Awesome spot with great view of the park and city. Food and service were good. Wine was great. Only negative was the weird decor with tiny birdhouses nailed to the wall. Like...are we supposed to think about bird shit while eating? Also, osprey make HUGE nests on platforms out by the ocean. What are these birdhouses supposed to mean? They are like for baby song birds. Just a really weird decor thing. Like the interior designer heard \"birds\" but then didn\\'t bother to google \"osprey\". It\\'s like the difference between a big deadly hunting sea bird and a sparrow.... It would be like naming a place \"orca\" and then putting 10 fishbowls w goldfish on the wall. It\\'s just weird.',\n",

I came here for lunch with some girl friends and while it was nice to sit by their big windows sipping wine, I just wish the food was better. The beef skewers - pretty tough and chewy, so prob a cheaper cut of meat?Tuna tatare - this was good. fish was fresh and the flavor was niceBrussel sprouts salad - this was good but the dressing was too sourHen of the woods (mushroom salad) - this was goodSeafood cobb - this was disappointing. You get a lobster tail, 2 pcs of whole shrimp, a few chunks of crab, 1 egg split in half topped with fish roe, 1/2 avocado, grape tomatoes, corn, bacon and crumbly blue cheese. This is more of a eat everything separately since you can't really mix the whole chunks of everything. So the concept is nice especially if you're a seafood lover like me, but the taste? It just didn't go together.Hanger Steak and fries - DRY AF. DO NOT get thisOur waiter was very nice and accommodating especially with our wine selection.

       "  \"Sunday in Brooklyn is a must try brunch spot. Doesn't matter if it's Monday or Tuesday, or any other day of the week, it's still going to be delicious. If you do end up coming on Sunday, I'm sure the food will taste EXTRA delicious cause you went the extra mile ; ) I've been to SIB twice already and both times left me with nothing but praise for them. Their food's are all cooked a certain way so there isn't a lot of customization in terms of cook, but that's ok because they do it really well.Ambiance/Environment - 5 starsThey really did a great job with the space. There is a lot of character as you can tell with all the unorthodox spaces and nooks throughout the space and you could tell they really made it into their own. It's clean and they're as organized as you can be with one of the top brunch spots in BK. They have well-spaced out outdoor patio seating with partitions away from the walking pedestrian during these pandemic times. Servide - 4.5 starsThe hostess and manager were on top of it. They quote you how long the wait is and take your number to text you when they are ready for you. We were quoted an hour but they actually were able to seat us much faster within 20 minutes. We were able to go down to a local coffee shop and chill and relax till they were ready. Only knock I had to give was our waitress was so busy so we weren't waited on as much as I would have liked, but still did a decent job. Food - 4.5 starsMy partner and I got the staples to try. We had a single of the Hazelnut Maple Praline Pancake, a sausage egg and cheese sandwich with cheddar on a brioche bun. And lastly we got a fried chicken sandwich. *Hazelnut Maple Praline Pancake was so rich with flavors. There is a melted piece of butter on top and you get this slight sweet and savory bite as you eat it. The pancake itself is pretty thick so I would recommend sharing or a single really is enough. \\xa0**Sausage Egg and Cheese Sandwich was delicious and really huge! Look at the picture I took of the section. This thing is filling and worth your money. The melted cheddar was a nice tough. ***Fried Chicken Sandwich was our 2nd time getting it. They use thigh meat and it's light and crispy. The kewpie mayo and shredded lettuce added this nice light crunch to go with the chicken. I was thoroughly happy to have this again. Summary:Great spot for a group of 2-4 for an epic brunch. They have very limited spots for reservations so it's mostly first come first serve. I would highly recommend going early and if you're going during prime time of 11:30 to 2 PM expect anywhere from 20min to an hour waits. But it's ok, there's plenty of spots to hang out near by until they're ready and text you.Highly recommend the sausage egg and cheese sandwich, the fried chicken sandwich and the maple pancakes were all amazing. Just really depends on what type of mood you're in! : )\",\n",
       "  \"Sunday in Brooklyn was my first outdoor dining experience during the pandemic.I made a reservation even though it was a Friday morning. There's a limited number of these outdoor greenhouses that line the sidewalk (about 8-10 of them). They're basically as the name describes: individual greenhouses, with a picnic table, which seems like it could fit four comfortably. The seat was cushioned so yay for my butt.Sure, you can dine inside or you can dine in your own private COVID-19 safe space (or as close to it as you can get while being out in public). The door on my greenhouse kept getting stuck and I swore I was going to have to make fast friends with the waiter trying to pry it open. The day was fairly chilly but I felt comfortable inside the greenhouse even though the heat lamp above wasn't on. I'm sure it would be even nicer on a 70 degree day. By the time I left, an hour later, all the greenhouses looked occupied. _______I kept it pretty simple (because I'm ....basic?) and had the avocado toast ($15) and added on a 6-minute egg which is almost the same thing as a poached egg (the kitchen couldn't do a poached egg at the time). Not sure how much extra it was because I don't think I ever saw the itemized bill (or maybe I wasn't paying attention when I paid..oops). I've read other people complain about there not being enough avocado on the avocado toast. False: there is a good amount of both mashed and chunky avocado spread across the sourdough bread, which in and of itself was THICK and crusty and rustic. There was a lot of salad and hazelnuts/walnuts on top, lots of crunch and mess. This is definitely a fork and knife situation, not a pick up the avocado toast and feed it into your mouth situation. An avocado toast is essentially an avocado toast no matter how you dress it. I was just glad it was something that didn't come from my kitchen.I also ordered a latte ($6) which was nice (see: it didn't come from kitchen). Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience and I would definitely come back and order a larger variety of things with other fully vaccinated humans. $31 after tax and the COVID surcharge, before tip.\",\n",
       "  \"Worthy of the hype. Came for brunch and wasn't disappointed.Had a seat outside for a party of three in one of their little private enclosures. They had heat lamps in there for those colder days. Reservations are made through Resy, and I'd recommend them so you're not stuck waiting around for a table.Menus can be viewed on your phone through the QR code at the table. The place has COVID measures in place, and they ask that your party masks up whenever a staff member enters your space - I appreciate that the business doing what it can to protect its workers.Now on to the food. Started with a Sunday Bloody, which turned into 3 by the end of the meal - this was probably one of the best Bloodys I've had in a while. Great spicy kick and the mezcal is perfect with it. We got some pancakes to share - these things are no joke. I think it's a bit of a misnomer to call them pancakes, as they are so thick - more like big flat cake doughnuts. Regardless, they were delicious. I had the Don Ruben omelette which I loved - I was surprised at the quality of the mole. I was completely stuffed by the end of the meal.Great spot for brunch, and would definitely be back to try more of their menu - also wouldn't mind coming back during dinner hours too to check it out.\",\n",

       "  'Sunday in Brooklyn definitely lived up to the hype.I went during a weekday for brunch and was seated in one of the cozy outdoor enclosures. The drinks we tried were really unique and presentable and the staff was very helpful and friendly.The food was truly memorable. First, we had to try the famous pancakes that were perfectly fluffy and smothered in a chocolate hazelnut buttery spread. The avocado toast was delectable and presented beautifully. Lastly, the shakshuka was filled with flavor and the eggs were perfectly poached. I would honestly try everything on the brunch menu, based off the how much we enjoyed just these three things.It is nearly impossible to get a weekend brunch reservation, so plan well ahead, even if going during the week.',\n",
       "  \"I tried to make a reservations on the resy site, but nothing was available. But walk-ins are accepted and there were a lot of tables available.

The menu is in a QR code which is great for the environment, tech savvy and sanitary. They also, add in a covid-19 recovery fee which is 3% (not a huge charge). I'll go into what was ordered - went right into the entrees so got the Half Wood Roasted Chicken which comes with Sunday Fries made of Za'atar, Chili Flakes, and Spicy Mayo on the side. Grilled Aged Skirt Steak was ordered too which came with Chimichurri sauce, Wood Roasted Carrots and Arugula. I must admit all looked presentable but taste wise it wasn't amazing. Price point wise it was a bit much. Didn't get an appetizer or a dish to share because I wanted to try for the Dessert instead. \\xa0Tried out the Warm Pear Crumble which had Toasted Pecans, Whiskey, Fresh Whipped Cream and got Vanilla Ice Cream on the side (a la mode). The dessert was so tasty that I'm glad that it was chosen. All in all I wouldn't go back as the entrees were average and the service was just alright. Our waitress kept going to the table next to us to suck up to whomever was sitting there. Must have been a big shot because everyone on staff dropped to say hello while he was trying to impress his date. He asked for the special of the day. I'm like how come we weren't notified there was a specials? Anyways, I felt like we were just lowly peons who were just waiting around to be served.\",\n",

I chose avocado, of course. It was absolutely delicious.The steak and eggs came steak, eggs, potatoes, and bread. The steak was well cooked. It was very juicy and tender. I would recommend trying this when you visit Sunday in Brooklyn!The pancakes are a must-try! My friends and I ordered a double pancake to share. The hazelnut maple praline flavor melts into your mouth. It's very light, tender, and fluffy! I got the honey bear on holiday because it looked so cute! Not only it's Instagram-able, but it's also very tasty! There's a light kick of rum with a sweetened honey taste. Overall, Sunday in Brooklyn is a must-try if you're around Williamsburg!\",\n",

I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but I LOVE the pancakes here. Their pancakes are huge, fluffy and topped with hazelnut maple praline sauce. The flavor is like a milder nutella and they're amazing!My wife had the Don Ruben Omelette and by all accounts she loved it. I tried the maitake and oyster mushrooms and they were great.I had the Sunday Burger which was way bigger than I expected. The sesame bun and the thick slice of cheddar really elevated this burger.I hope to be back one day as this is a very charming spot to eat in East Williamsburg.

A little pricey. But delicious. My friend ordered the cheddar eggs with home fries and sausage. It was also yummy!! Philip our server was sweet and informative!! Really liked this place.

No wait and several tables remained available during the duration our dinner.Server suggested two dishes per person but we had more than that. The edamame dumplings were a standout. We've never had anything quite like it and they were cooked well. The batter that the soft shell crab was cooked in leaned sweet. It reminded me almost of the sweetness of funnel cake, which I personally enjoy. I just missed the actual flavor of the crab because all I could taste was the sweet batter. Kimchi paella was solid. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the lucky noodle dish but I enjoyed the chewiness of the torn noodles with the crispness of the vegetables. I can't handle a lot of spice and could easily eat both the kimchi paella and lucky noodles. Eel tacos were also made well, no complaints. Truffle mac and cheese was tasty. Steak was very flavorful and soft.I enjoyed trying yuzu beer for the first time as well. Worth checking out if the menu piques your interest.

The plantains were definitely our favorite but of course we forgot to take a picture... the tuna tartar and bread pudding were also at the top of our list. Everything else was also really good but a bit too filling since the mac n cheese and paella were just carbs. Overall, I would suggest getting 5-6 items for 2 people if you're pretty hungry.\",\n",
       " \"The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the extremely long wait time because there's no reservation system- but the food is amazing! There are so many reviews for this restaurant and the hype is understandable. We came at 7pm on a Friday, where the wait was 2.5 hours for 4 people. Luckily, our friends lived nearby so we killed the time at their place. When finally seated, every dish that was brought on was astonishing. The only thing is I wish the portions were bigger! At first look, the pricing looks quite decent but the dishes, since it's tapas style, are quite small especially when shared. I'd recommend coming here with a small party. The standout was the truffle Mac and cheese and eel taco personally. Just the perfect amount of truffle drizzled on the creamy Mac and cheese leaves you wanting so much more! The eel taco is quite unique, and the guac adds a light twist to what might be a heavy bite. Be prepared to wait if you come, but also be prepared to have an unforgettable meal.\",\n",

Beautiful tapas sized plates were shared amongst my group.It is an art and every bite should take you on a rollercoaster ride.My kids are 10 + 8 years old and I'm so grateful they were able to experience this journey through all the different plates. They loved it and had a better understanding of each one. Omg!! What a great meal from start to finish. I have been dying to try Thursday kitchen for the longest time. We came on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated immediately (IMO the best spot for outdoor dining). We decided to share as many dishes as we could and left feeling full and satisfied. We ordered: Edamame dumplings 8/10- overall flavor was delicious but texture a little mushy for my taste Steak 7/10- steak was a little tough but the flavors were excellent Truffle mac and cheese 10/10 *MUST ORDER* - everything you could ever want. That cheese pull though Kimchi paella 9/10 *MUST ORDER* - amazing mix of flavors and perfectly cooked seafood Gnocchi 6/10 - gnocchi had amazing texture but the sauce was a little too sweetDefinitely recommend checking Thursday Kitchen out for small but filling bites! Great place for catching up with friends or date night! We came on a Monday evening right when it opened. No wait and several tables remained available during the duration our dinner.Server suggested two dishes per person but we had more than that. The edamame dumplings were a standout. We've never had anything quite like it and they were cooked well. The batter that the soft shell crab was cooked in leaned sweet. It reminded me almost of the sweetness of funnel cake, which I personally enjoy. I just missed the actual flavor of the crab because all I could taste was the sweet batter. Kimchi paella was solid. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the lucky noodle dish but I enjoyed the chewiness of the torn noodles with the crispness of the vegetables. I can't handle a lot of spice and could easily eat both the kimchi paella and lucky noodles. Eel tacos were also made well, no complaints. Truffle mac and cheese was tasty. Steak was very flavorful and soft.I enjoyed trying yuzu beer for the first time as well. Worth checking out if the menu piques your interest. No high chairs were offered and there's no changing table in the restroom. Came to Thursday Kitchen this evening for my birthday since this is my favorite restaurant. \\xa0Yet another great meal here. This time we tried the soupy and spicy Korean chili pepper gnocchi. My boyfriend got the kimchi paella which he said was really good. I always get the lucky noodle and the Korean popcorn chicken. \\xa0We also enjoyed the lettuce jem salad. Really you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu at this place. The drinks and service were also excellent as always. \\xa0Can't wait to be back again al summer Great food and great service. Everything came out fast and the people that work there are really nice. We got the Korean popcorn chicken, lucky noodle, edamame dumplings and truffle Mac and cheese. My favorite were the lucky noodles. It was spicy but I prefer my food to be in the spicier side. The portions are meant to be small plate portions but they still are quite generous. Drinks are great as well. Can't wait to come back My friend and I went on a Monday night and it was very busy. Luckily we were able to get seated immediately around 6:30 PM. We got the tuna tartar, plantains, truffle mac n cheese, soft shell crab katsu, kimchi paella, and bread pudding topped with blueberries. The plantains were definitely our favorite but of course we forgot to take a picture... the tuna tartar and bread pudding were also at the top of our list. Everything else was also really good but a bit too filling since the mac n cheese and paella were just carbs. Overall, I would suggest getting 5-6 items for 2 people if you're pretty hungry. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the extremely long wait time because there's no reservation system- but the food is amazing! There are so many reviews for this restaurant and the hype is understandable. We came at 7pm on a Friday, where the wait was 2.5 hours for 4 people. Luckily, our friends lived nearby so we killed the time at their place. When finally seated, every dish that was brought on was astonishing. The only thing is I wish the portions were bigger! At first look, the pricing looks quite decent but the dishes, since it's tapas style, are quite small especially when shared. I'd recommend coming here with a small party. The standout was the truffle Mac and cheese and eel taco personally. Just the perfect amount of truffle drizzled on the creamy Mac and cheese leaves you wanting so much more! The eel taco is quite unique, and the guac adds a light twist to what might be a heavy bite. Be prepared to wait if you come, but also be prepared to have an unforgettable meal. Thursday Kitchen offers a unique menu of food and drinks in the setting of a warm and welcoming place. I came here on a, you guessed it, Thursday evening. We ordered the kimchi paella and truffle mac and cheese. If you're lactose intolerant, pack your pill because you're going to need it. These dishes were extra cheesy with the pull and all. True beauty. The flavors came through with each bite. I recommend these dishes. They are more filling than you think.The drinks come in plastic pouches. We got Lychee Reach Rich and Ruby the GF. Both delicious but do know that Ruby has rosé and not rose which I found out the fun way. The service here is wonderful. Our waitress was hilarious and made our dining experience memorable. Was brought to this incredible spot by a friend, and I cannot wait to go back ASAP! We lined up a few minutes before they opened at 5PM on a Saturday night, and there was already quite a crowd. We got seated shortly, and ordered drinks, and two family-style dishes to share. The Plantains were out of this world, and the Korean Popcorn Chicken was absolutely incredible. One of the best meals I've had in a long time with great service too!! Highly recommend.\"],\n",
       " 'The Cabin NYC': ['205 E 4th St New York, NY 10009 Your trust is our top concern, so businesses can\\'t pay to alter or remove their reviews. Learn more. Start your review of The Cabin NYC. This establishment doesnt give enough stars, if i could it 10 stars i would. The atmosphere, music and food is beyond amazing. The owner is friendly and accommodate everyone beyond measures. Do yourself a favor and visit the cabin, its not a restaurant its an experience Any place that has a good old school Hip Hop and R & B is usually a spot that I want to be at!Myself and a friend met here for brunch and seriously did a two step to my table b/c the music was hitting! The decor of this spot is what I would call city rustic. Wood everywhere, but city slick. The staff was great... attentive and quick. I\\'ve been given those in the service industry all the praise. I can imagine how hard it\\'s been working with limited resources,in a hot mask and gloves....and still have to deal with people who seem to have forgotten we\\'re still in the middle of a pandemic. No, it\\'s not as bad as it was before, but please give people in the service industry grace. Okay, I\\'m jumping off my soap box.The drink of choice for me was the Eastside. If you like gin cocktails, you\\'ll love it. If not, try it anyway... lol. For food I had the breakfast club scrambler. It\\'s usually made with egg whites, but I asked for the entire egg b/c I knew I needed more protein. My friend had the soul for real chicken and waffles. The chicken was a bit bland ( that\\'s why only 4 ). The lack of flavor was sad, when the rest of the meal was really great. I do plan on checking this spot out for dinner. I\\'ll be the one dancing in my seat :-) I just KNEW I would love this place. I have had this place saved in my folder for a while and had finally ventured over! I made a reservation before coming because this place fills up quickly (to COVID capacity of course because yes, they follow all guidelines). The people were so kind especially when I asked about their gluten free options. The chef got on the phone with me and explained all of their options. It\\'s rare you get customer service like that but it made me even more excited for the reservation. We got there and of course we were reminded of the 90 minute time limit, we were given a great booth with the tree and flowers encapsulating us. The waiter and waitress were so kind and patient because we had some people running late, I needed a new mask, we couldn\\'t decide on drinks and food. haha. We were a little all over the place.Food: EXCELLENT! I loveddddddd the bacon dates and still think about them. The french fries were amazing, they were kind of steak cut which is usually something I hate but they were seasoned excellently (truffle oil, people!). I also loved the Brussel sprouts. This place is perfect for people like me who like healthy food that is transformed into comfort food (hence the name). The rest of the table loved the fried chicken but of course, I couldn\\'t eat it since it\\'s not GF. Drinks: Oh my! We ordered the El Flamingo and it was perfect! It was definitely a \"pretty\" drink and was just light enough to make you smile but get you feeling \"good\". The El Flamingo actually complimented all of the food I ate as well and that\\'s rare for me to find which is why I usually drink water when I eat. Ambience: Super cute! Heavy on the wood accents which makes sense because of the name. The backyard seating was a little lackluster but did the job. The inside is what really sells this place. My regret was not getting the s\\'mores but that\\'s OK because it means I need to go back. I came to the cabin for their weekend Throwback Brunch. We were seated in the back patio. They have a tent set up with some decor to make it look nice. I\\'d hope that once things get back to normal, they would really make that into a nice outdoor eating area. The tent was fine for the current situation. The music was good. They played mostly throwback r&b Jams and they had a separate speaker in the back patio. We ordered the 3 for $10 drinks. You had a choice of mimosas, screwdriver, Bloody Mary or a beer (I believe). \\xa0Note: you can only order that deal once. Lol. Anyways, I went with the mimosas and they were good. After I asked our waiter \"what were the favorites,\" I chose his recommendation for the Brunch Burger. It was delicious and I\\'d def order it again. Overall, it was a good experience and I\\'d definitely come back. The inside is very artsy and beautiful. Great spot for some good cocktails! Came here on a busy day after indoor dining opened up. Managed getting late reservation. Unfortunately it is a hard for a girl to sit on the drum seats! Loved the indoor vibes, but just to be more comfortable we moved outdoors. The patio felt like a college frat party! \\xa0Indoors definitely had a classy vibe. This is a good spot for vegetarians! They are small plates but good portion. If you love a twist in mac and cheese, they do try that! I loved their Brussels sprouts and the \\xa0veggie burger. The burrata could have been better, or maybe I have high expectations. The host was very sweet and accommodating. Will definitely go back and enjoy some more drinks and enjoy the indoor dining vibe! What a NYC gem! From the atmosphere, to the food, to the service, everything is outstanding here! If you haven\\'t been, you\\'re missing out! So if I had to be honest I would give this place a 3.5.The out of 5 stars. Don\\'t get me wrong the food was amazing and it was a cute spot in LES. Now, the portion sizes were extremely small and I know it\\'s a taps bar but it comes off as more of a resturant based on the photos and menu I saw earlier throughout the day. The main reason I give it a lower rating is because the service was so RUSHED and ALMOST RUDE about ordering drinks. I totally understand that it\\'s COVID times and we all need to make that money, but no where on my reservation or even check in time did I hear a word about a time limit. They also said we couldn\\'t \\xa0sit and wait for the rest of our party at our table that was RESERVED FOR US BASED ON CAPACITY. Basically my boyfriend and I couldn\\'t sit inside at the table we reserved for three while waiting on our third guest. Doesn\\'t make any sense to me. Regardless I\\'m not gonna give them a bad rating , because it was a very vibrant place in LES that I would definitely want to try another time for brunch or an earlier menu. Their bacon wrapped dates were delicious and so were the Brussels sprouts! Just wish the portion sizes were bigger! The decorations were really cute and I feel like during a normal time in life the bar would be poppin! I stalked this place for a few days. It was my bestie bday and I was doing a surprise photoshoot. This place was perfect for it. Theres a cute little area to take great pics. The tree right in the middle decorated with leaves did it for me too. I was impressed with the decor. I honestly wasn\\'t crazy about the food. I enjoyed y brussel sprouts but I had the sugar on the side. It was a nice added touch but I wanted to be in control on home much I wanted on there. The shrimp was my favorite item on the menu. I took one bite out of the fried chicken and couldn\\'t eat anymore. It didn\\'t even look appetizing honestly. It was dry and lacked flavor. The meatballs weren\\'t good either. The bread was good when dipped in the sauce the shrimp came in. Our drinks were ok.Overall I would return. Our waitress was friendly. The food here is honestly mediocre. Let me start with the good things. The ambiance is gorgeous. Love the tree in the middle and that nature-esque vibe. As my friend called it, it was \"London meets Montana\". Amazing music as well! As with the food, I went with a party of 4 and shared 4 items. We ordered the truffle fries which was amazing, the not so Caesar salad which was alright. The fried chicken was mediocre but the cole slaw was not it. The veggies didn\\'t compliment each other. We also ordered the s\\'mores which was a bit disappointing in my opinion. However the biggest disappointment was the portion sizes. Again, we were encouraged to share but the portions were just sadly tiny. For $12, I\\'d love more fries. The $17 fried chicken for 2 Small pieces was not worth it at all. All and all, the food is here is wayyy overpriced for the portion you are getting which is really sad because I really wanted to like this place. I\\'ve been here for brunch prior which the food wasn\\'t great in my opinion. The drinks were not bad! Good spot for brunch- the food is fine, drinks are cheap. They have outdoor seating in their backyard- it\\'s covered and they have fall themed decorations throughout the restaurant and it\\'s cute. They have a drinks special during brunch where you get 3 drinks ( choice of Bloody Mary, mimosa, screwdriver, a local ale) for $10 - fantastic deal and the drinks are pretty strong. The food is fine- nothing exceptional but not bad either. They\\'re served in to-go containers with plastic cutlery. Another thing to mention- we were here at noon for brunch and the restaurant was out of coffee!The restaurant is very cognizant of social distancing and enforce it, check your temperature before you get seated, take down contact information for contact tracing and the staff wears masks at all times. The service was impeccable.'],\n",

COVID dining update -So happy to be able to return to my favorite spot for brunch! Amélie is still as delicious as I remembered.Indoor dining felt quite safe here. They had extremely high partitions between tables that were not spaced 6\\' apart (but otherwise social distancing was observed). Less than 25% of capacity was used indoors when we dined on Sat during brunch (outdoors was quite bustling).My husband and I shared our favorite menu items, including the chicken liver mousse (which was listed as a separate brunch special item - so don\\'t be disappointed when you don\\'t see it on the regular brunch menu online!), moules frites, and grilled octopus. The first two hadn\\'t changed a bit, but the octopus was updated from a ratatouille base to a tabouleh, which I thought was a nice improvement. Amélie is my go-to for weekend brunch (but also casual date nights) and I basically order the same spread each time. It\\'s an easy fallback because you can\\'t really go wrong with anything on the menu. I don\\'t usually go for the entrees, because I love sharing a bunch of small dishes among friends. My must-orders are the chicken liver mousse (super rich and creamy) and the moules frites. Their french fries are great and I love the dipping sauces! The mussel broth is also perfect for soaking up with bread. I also love the goat cheese ball, French onion soup, beef tartare... basically everything on the menu. The service is also extremely nice each time - once they forgot my add-on of truffles on my \"Gratin de Ravioles\" order (think elevated mac-and-cheese) and they brought out a generous serving of truffles, free of charge. Dinner gets a bit busy, but brunch is extremely easy to just walk in. My food friend was eyeing this place and I\\'m so glad we stopped by. At first I was thinking how does a French restaurant with wine have so many reviews in NY, but Amelie did not disappoint. We ordered the lobster risotto, duck leg confit, octopus and escargot. Plenty of food for 4 people. The risotto was great in texture and had a fair amount of labor. The duck was cooked perfectly. Crispy skin on the outside and fall off the bone meat on the inside. The grilled octopus and escargot are a must order as well. We also had some wine flights which were priced very nicely during happy hour even on a Sunday. Love how they have happy hour even on the weekends. The drink menu is extensive here. Highly recommend making reservations prior to dining here as the seats filled up very quickly. The restaurant ambience is great with all of the wine bottles along the wall. Amelie takes Covid seriously as the entire staff is wearing gloves and masks. Highly recommend this restaurant if you want great food, wine and a place to people watch as well I finally understand why one of my girlfriends has been suggesting this place of the last 5 years. This place is situated just a few blocks from Washington Square Park which I think is probably the best location for this restaurant. When you arrive at Amelie you will feel like you are back in arrondissement 7 or maybe even 9. The staff is awesome so attentive and helpful. The follow COVID rules and have heat lamps. We ordered the Cheese and Charcuterie board which was GENEROUS. It had a great balance of cheese and meats and guess what? They had GF CRACKERS FOR ME! They might of thought I was a little over the top with my one million \\'thank you\\'s\" but it is so hard to go to a restaurant and find GF crackers!!! I ordered the Steak Au Poivre which had sliced pieces of steak with sauce drizzled on top and a side of french fries and side salad. The steak was \\xa0cooked perfectly, not too chewy, and had the right amount of softness paired decently with the sauce. I thought it was going to be more of a Bolognese (please don\\'t ask me why I thought this lol) but it wasn\\'t and I\\'m happy it wasn\\'t. I know some feel like they go heavy on the sauce but I personally thought it was the right amount. The fries were delicious and so was the cute side salad. The wine was awesome as well. I\\'m excited to go back ! My friend and I sat outside and shared burrata, Brussel sprouts, and their Charcuterie Plate. It\\'s in a fun location on a busy street of outdoor dining.Their wine and service was good. I overheard an older couple say they\\'ve been going there for like 15 years? it\\'s good mix of different types of people I am a critic when it comes to wine and this place did not disappoint. I during the daily happy hour for a nice night on the town before dinner with my partner. We got every single flight and really enjoyed them. Be me and just go for every flight and roll with it. I used the wall for wine glass storage for the flights I wasn\\'t using. There were 4 flights total with 3 tastings each but it\\'s a blast. I would say each taste had about 2 oz and would be equivalent to a glass of wine. There were maybe 3 wines we could have done without. The Malbec and Canary Island Wines were good and the Rhone Grenache and California Cab fell flat. The whites were pleasant.Happy hour escargot and goat cheese for the win. Cheers! 4.25 stars. Good restaurant for a special occasion or when craving French food. Came with reservations and it might be hard to get a seat without one. The restaurant had a modern French vibe to it with modern music. 1. Escargot - 4.5/5. Very good and tasty. Comes smoking hot with plenty of toppings. Would get double this next time as my meal!2. Duck - Flavorful and tender. Good portion.3. Beef bourguignon - Plenty of sauce. Felt like needed more veggies alongside the meat though. The meat itself was on the drier side but the sauce made up for it.Overall, a good French restaurant with a modern vibe. I would try at least once. It has brand name in NYC. This adorable French restaurant is delicious!!!! Everything we ordered was incredible, and I was so happy being there. We started with the goat cheese ball and burrata. They were both so soft and had tons of flavor. The burrata was probably the best I\\'ve ever had.For my entree, I got the steak au poivre. That\\'s ones of my favorite foods, and this place makes a phenomenal one. Cooked perfectly to my request at medium rare. Sauce was perfect and fries were perfect.Definitely go here!!! Absolutely delicious food, worth every penny! Wonderful wine selection and I appreciated that they offered wine flights to allow us to try different wines. I haven\\'t noticed wine flights offered elsewhere. We sat outdoors and enjoyed the pleasant spring evening.We started with pistachio goat cheese ball served over caramelized onions and the soup of the day which was a creamy asparagus soup with bacon bits. Both were interesting items. They have a lot of appealing appetizers. For the main course, we shared the raviolis topped with truffles and one of the specials - the duck magret. Like the appetizer, a lot of interesting options. I liked the creativity and appeal to savory and rich foods. The duck was great. It had a crispy skin. We were deciding between having it cooked medium rare or medium, and the waiter recommended medium. I would have been interested to see how it would have come out medium rare.For dessert, we had a créeme brûlée. The cream was topped with bananas before it was torched. The staff was very attentive. A great place to dine for 1-4 people. My husband and I stop by this restaurant for Saturday branch. \\xa0We were pleasantly surprised by nice tall partitions between the tables. Service was excellent and food was even better! \\xa0You must try burrata - it was out of this world!! Escargot were excellent too. \\xa0I was a little bit disappointed with muscles, but they easily redeem themselves with cremebrulee. I will gladly come back here any time!! Returned here for the first time since CoVid. The outdoor seating is very warm and well-ventilated. The multiple heaters, especially ones along the walls were so strong, I didn\\'t have to wear my puffer coat while enjoying wine. And the staffs are so professional, knowledgeable and courteous. They have plenty of by-glass options. I didn\\'t come here in time for HH wine flights (5-6pm), but they did sound good. Perhaps on my next visit if I could make it here by 6pm. $3.99+ fee $0 min 45-55 mins'],\n",

This restaurant is stunning with incredible outdoor seating to relax and enjoy. First time here, came to meet a friend for a late afternoon drink, and we had a great conversation because the music isn\\'t too loud at that time. Modern, fresh, and vibrant ambience with amazing lighting that is both warm and welcoming. I ordered a couple of drinks, which were reasonably priced and served well. While I did not order food, I must say that the waiters were extremely helpful, and friendly. I\\'d definitely visit soon. My partner and I celebrated his birthday (and our first nice dinner out since being vaccinated!) and it was an incredible experience from start to finish. The interior of the restaurant was gorgeous and the strict safety precautions for COVID put us at ease. Megan (our server/bartender) was incredible and attentive, going as far as to bring out the bottle of tamarind liquor used in one of the cocktails so my nerdy mixologist partner could geek out about it. We also got to meet Chef Miranda, who came out to greet us upon hearing we were celebrating a birthday. He was warm, humble, and incredibly accommodating, which made the brilliant meal he made us feel that much more special. We were floored by how delicious our dinner was (the ricotta agnolotti was the star!) and couldn\\'t have imagined a better night out. We already can\\'t wait to go back! My friend and I came here for dinner and it was pretty good! We made a reservation for 6:00 pm on a Saturday. Upon arrival, they took our temperatures and seated us immediately after. We were quickly served with water and they took our orders. They also brought over a folding tray stand (right next to our table) and told us they will serve our foods on that stand and when we are done to put the empty plates back on that stand. I definitely liked this approach, especially during a pandemic.We ordered:Parmesan Fries ($10.00): crispy shoestring, garlic, herbs, parmigiano-reggiano. Portion was plentiful for two people. The flavor was A+.Hens of the Wood ($22.00): roasted maitake mushroom, pickled honshimeji, parmesan, balsamic-soy reduction, chimichurri aioli. We really enjoyed this dish. Although the portion was on the smaller side and it was a bit too pricey. The highlight of this dish was definitely the chimichurri aioli. It paired perfectly with the mushroom.Striped Bass ($36.00): came with littleneck clams, toasted fregola, spicy tomato broth. WE ARE NOT A FAN. The bass was too fishy. I would not recommend this dish.Rotisserie Chicken ($29.00 - half): heritage bird, Jamaican jerk marinade, cornbread pudding, cabbage slaw, natural just. WOW, this chicken was so tender and meaty. It was not dry at all. The portion was just right for two people. I would recommend this!Service: it was really good overall. There is constantly someone checking up on us to refill our waters and ask how we are doing.One thing I want to point out was that there were no heating lamps and it can get chilly dining outdoors at night. COVID-related: -all tables were at least 6 feet apart-all employees wore a mask-temperature checks were administered upon check-in Awesome spot with great view of the park and city. Food and service were good. Wine was great. Only negative was the weird decor with tiny birdhouses nailed to the wall. Like...are we supposed to think about bird shit while eating? Also, osprey make HUGE nests on platforms out by the ocean. What are these birdhouses supposed to mean? They are like for baby song birds. Just a really weird decor thing. Like the interior designer heard \"birds\" but then didn\\'t bother to google \"osprey\". It\\'s like the difference between a big deadly hunting sea bird and a sparrow.... It would be like naming a place \"orca\" and then putting 10 fishbowls w goldfish on the wall. It\\'s just weird. Must try or may die regretting it!Great place for dinner with friends, your better half or just you taking yourself out on a date.Beautiful location \\xa0with views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan so close you can almost reach out ad touch. The food was delicious, and the staff were absolute stars despite a tiny oversight... our server forgot to put in our order. But that\\'s ok. She was polite. Go visit this place! We pass this restaurant often on our daily walks through the park. \\xa0 Its lush patio always intrigued me and it\\'s here that I dragged my bf here for his birthday, recently. \\xa0 He requested close and casual so it fit his bill. It was our first dinner out in nyc since lockdown (and likely our only meal out about town this year). \\xa0I do like that the hotel and restaurant take covid precautions seriously. \\xa0The host greeted us at the front, took our temperatures and then let us check in at the reception area. \\xa0They explained that there was a 3 step disinfecting process for tables. \\xa0Once we were led to our table, \\xa0(about 15 mins after our reservation) we were told to view menus by scanning QR codes- so no paper menus to touch. \\xa0 The tables were nicely spaced out. \\xa0 And of course, the setting is very pretty, a nice patio, with string lights and far away from car exhaust, pedestrians, runners and bicycles. \\xa0 if you\\'re neurotic/paranoid/anxious- this \\xa0restaurant is an excellent choice. \\xa0As for the rest of our experience - i would say it was good to adequate. Our server was pleasant but he struggled to keep up with the tables. I\\'ll spare the details. \\xa0I know everyone is trying their hardest and these are trying times. \\xa0Our pineapple jalapeno cocktails were excellent (best part of the meal) and the food \\xa0(tuna tartare, burger, jerk chicken) was average to just above average. \\xa0Portions were generous, prices on the higher end. Gratuity of 18pct (more than fair) will be included in your bill.Rating: 3.5 rounded up to 4. Great experience. How can you beat a great location in the beautiful park, but at the same time away from park walkers and bicyclists! Restaurant is located in the hotel, but we are outside on their beautiful patio. It feels casual , although it is not inexpensive, but moderate. Food was very good, and service was excellent. Hats off to Edgar, our server, who was , friendly, efficient and helpful. We were celebrating and he gave us complementary celebration drinks. It was a perfect experience and just a beautiful place. Great area to walk around before and / or afterwards: Brooklyn bridge park, \\xa0Brooklyn Heights, piers, ferries and near Dumbo. Sorry I forgot to take other photos. The ambience of this place is great but the food is nothing to brag about. I came here for lunch with some girl friends and while it was nice to sit by their big windows sipping wine, I just wish the food was better. The beef skewers - pretty tough and chewy, so prob a cheaper cut of meat?Tuna tatare - this was good. fish was fresh and the flavor was niceBrussel sprouts salad - this was good but the dressing was too sourHen of the woods (mushroom salad) - this was goodSeafood cobb - this was disappointing. You get a lobster tail, 2 pcs of whole shrimp, a few chunks of crab, 1 egg split in half topped with fish roe, 1/2 avocado, grape tomatoes, corn, bacon and crumbly blue cheese. This is more of a eat everything separately since you can\\'t really mix the whole chunks of everything. So the concept is nice especially if you\\'re a seafood lover like me, but the taste? It just didn\\'t go together.Hanger Steak and fries - DRY AF. DO NOT get thisOur waiter was very nice and accommodating especially with our wine selection.

Their food's are all cooked a certain way so there isn't a lot of customization in terms of cook, but that's ok because they do it really well.Ambiance/Environment - 5 starsThey really did a great job with the space. There is a lot of character as you can tell with all the unorthodox spaces and nooks throughout the space and you could tell they really made it into their own. It's clean and they're as organized as you can be with one of the top brunch spots in BK. They have well-spaced out outdoor patio seating with partitions away from the walking pedestrian during these pandemic times. Servide - 4.5 starsThe hostess and manager were on top of it. They quote you how long the wait is and take your number to text you when they are ready for you. We were quoted an hour but they actually were able to seat us much faster within 20 minutes. We were able to go down to a local coffee shop and chill and relax till they were ready. Only knock I had to give was our waitress was so busy so we weren't waited on as much as I would have liked, but still did a decent job. Food - 4.5 starsMy partner and I got the staples to try. We had a single of the Hazelnut Maple Praline Pancake, a sausage egg and cheese sandwich with cheddar on a brioche bun. And lastly we got a fried chicken sandwich. *Hazelnut Maple Praline Pancake was so rich with flavors. There is a melted piece of butter on top and you get this slight sweet and savory bite as you eat it. The pancake itself is pretty thick so I would recommend sharing or a single really is enough. \\xa0**Sausage Egg and Cheese Sandwich was delicious and really huge! Look at the picture I took of the section. This thing is filling and worth your money. The melted cheddar was a nice tough. ***Fried Chicken Sandwich was our 2nd time getting it. They use thigh meat and it's light and crispy. The kewpie mayo and shredded lettuce added this nice light crunch to go with the chicken. I was thoroughly happy to have this again. Summary:Great spot for a group of 2-4 for an epic brunch. They have very limited spots for reservations so it's mostly first come first serve. I would highly recommend going early and if you're going during prime time of 11:30 to 2 PM expect anywhere from 20min to an hour waits. But it's ok, there's plenty of spots to hang out near by until they're ready and text you.Highly recommend the sausage egg and cheese sandwich, the fried chicken sandwich and the maple pancakes were all amazing. Just really depends on what type of mood you're in! : ) Sunday in Brooklyn was my first outdoor dining experience during the pandemic.I made a reservation even though it was a Friday morning. There's a limited number of these outdoor greenhouses that line the sidewalk (about 8-10 of them). They're basically as the name describes: individual greenhouses, with a picnic table, which seems like it could fit four comfortably. The seat was cushioned so yay for my butt.Sure, you can dine inside or you can dine in your own private COVID-19 safe space (or as close to it as you can get while being out in public). The door on my greenhouse kept getting stuck and I swore I was going to have to make fast friends with the waiter trying to pry it open. The day was fairly chilly but I felt comfortable inside the greenhouse even though the heat lamp above wasn't on. I'm sure it would be even nicer on a 70 degree day. By the time I left, an hour later, all the greenhouses looked occupied. _______I kept it pretty simple (because I'm ....basic?) and had the avocado toast ($15) and added on a 6-minute egg which is almost the same thing as a poached egg (the kitchen couldn't do a poached egg at the time). Not sure how much extra it was because I don't think I ever saw the itemized bill (or maybe I wasn't paying attention when I paid..oops). I've read other people complain about there not being enough avocado on the avocado toast. False: there is a good amount of both mashed and chunky avocado spread across the sourdough bread, which in and of itself was THICK and crusty and rustic. There was a lot of salad and hazelnuts/walnuts on top, lots of crunch and mess. This is definitely a fork and knife situation, not a pick up the avocado toast and feed it into your mouth situation. An avocado toast is essentially an avocado toast no matter how you dress it. I was just glad it was something that didn't come from my kitchen.I also ordered a latte ($6) which was nice (see: it didn't come from kitchen). Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience and I would definitely come back and order a larger variety of things with other fully vaccinated humans. $31 after tax and the COVID surcharge, before tip. Worthy of the hype. Came for brunch and wasn't disappointed.Had a seat outside for a party of three in one of their little private enclosures. They had heat lamps in there for those colder days. Reservations are made through Resy, and I'd recommend them so you're not stuck waiting around for a table.Menus can be viewed on your phone through the QR code at the table. The place has COVID measures in place, and they ask that your party masks up whenever a staff member enters your space - I appreciate that the business doing what it can to protect its workers.Now on to the food. Started with a Sunday Bloody, which turned into 3 by the end of the meal - this was probably one of the best Bloodys I've had in a while. Great spicy kick and the mezcal is perfect with it. We got some pancakes to share - these things are no joke. I think it's a bit of a misnomer to call them pancakes, as they are so thick - more like big flat cake doughnuts. Regardless, they were delicious. I had the Don Ruben omelette which I loved - I was surprised at the quality of the mole. I was completely stuffed by the end of the meal.Great spot for brunch, and would definitely be back to try more of their menu - also wouldn't mind coming back during dinner hours too to check it out. Love the place, hate the wait time It was a 2 hr wait so we just walked around to the park and different stores in the area. The Malted pancakes were delicious. The star of the show. And the rest of the food was good as well. The teddy bear drink was unique out of a honey bottle. I really like when restaurants are creative. Sunday in Brooklyn definitely lived up to the hype.I went during a weekday for brunch and was seated in one of the cozy outdoor enclosures. The drinks we tried were really unique and presentable and the staff was very helpful and friendly.The food was truly memorable. First, we had to try the famous pancakes that were perfectly fluffy and smothered in a chocolate hazelnut buttery spread. The avocado toast was delectable and presented beautifully. Lastly, the shakshuka was filled with flavor and the eggs were perfectly poached. I would honestly try everything on the brunch menu, based off the how much we enjoyed just these three things.It is nearly impossible to get a weekend brunch reservation, so plan well ahead, even if going during the week. I tried to make a reservations on the resy site, but nothing was available. But walk-ins are accepted and there were a lot of tables available. They first take your temperature and ask for your information such as phone number and address. All staff wear masks. The menu is in a QR code which is great for the environment, tech savvy and sanitary. They also, add in a covid-19 recovery fee which is 3% (not a huge charge). I'll go into what was ordered - went right into the entrees so got the Half Wood Roasted Chicken which comes with Sunday Fries made of Za'atar, Chili Flakes, and Spicy Mayo on the side. Grilled Aged Skirt Steak was ordered too which came with Chimichurri sauce, Wood Roasted Carrots and Arugula. I must admit all looked presentable but taste wise it wasn't amazing. Price point wise it was a bit much. Didn't get an appetizer or a dish to share because I wanted to try for the Dessert instead. \\xa0Tried out the Warm Pear Crumble which had Toasted Pecans, Whiskey, Fresh Whipped Cream and got Vanilla Ice Cream on the side (a la mode). The dessert was so tasty that I'm glad that it was chosen. All in all I wouldn't go back as the entrees were average and the service was just alright. Our waitress kept going to the table next to us to suck up to whomever was sitting there. Must have been a big shot because everyone on staff dropped to say hello while he was trying to impress his date. He asked for the special of the day. I'm like how come we weren't notified there was a specials? Anyways, I felt like we were just lowly peons who were just waiting around to be served. Sunday in Brooklyn is one of my favorite brunch spots! I came here on a Saturday with 4 of my other friends. The wait was about one hour and 30 minutes.The waitress sat us down inside and took our orders quickly. My friends and I ordered the cheddar scramble, steak and eggs, hazelnut pancakes, and honey bear on holiday.The cheddar scramble came eggs, potatoes, bread, and a choice of avocado, sausage, or chicken sausage. I chose avocado, of course. It was absolutely delicious.The steak and eggs came steak, eggs, potatoes, and bread. The steak was well cooked. It was very juicy and tender. I would recommend trying this when you visit Sunday in Brooklyn!The pancakes are a must-try! My friends and I ordered a double pancake to share. The hazelnut maple praline flavor melts into your mouth. It's very light, tender, and fluffy! I got the honey bear on holiday because it looked so cute! Not only it's Instagram-able, but it's also very tasty! There's a light kick of rum with a sweetened honey taste. Overall, Sunday in Brooklyn is a must-try if you're around Williamsburg! I've had this place on my foodie list for so long! Finally got to go this week and everything was so great. We made a reservation for their super cute little outdoor individual dining pods. Our server, Carlos, was great and our food and drinks came out very fast. The ambiance was great, food was AMAZING and drinks were good too. You MUST try the hazelnut praline pancake. Period. I've added it to the best things I've ever eaten! I ordered the Don Ruben Omelette which was excellent and the La Isla Bonita cocktail. Definitely can't wait to come back here and eat through their menu. Oh my goodness - I'm so impressed with this place. I came here for brunch on a weekday so we didn't need a reservation and we were able to get seated immediately. Their outdoor booths during COVID-19 are pretty adorable.You have to order the Sunday Pancakes here - whether you're a fan of pancakes or not. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but I LOVE the pancakes here. Their pancakes are huge, fluffy and topped with hazelnut maple praline sauce. The flavor is like a milder nutella and they're amazing!My wife had the Don Ruben Omelette and by all accounts she loved it. I tried the maitake and oyster mushrooms and they were great.I had the Sunday Burger which was way bigger than I expected. The sesame bun and the thick slice of cheddar really elevated this burger.I hope to be back one day as this is a very charming spot to eat in East Williamsburg. If you come during peak brunch hours on a weekend make a reservation in advance or expect a hour+ wait. Like this place. Came in for brunch with a friend. Drinks were on point. We both had the Mangolorian. It had a little too much ice but other than that it was good. I ordered the burger which was delicious. For the cost of it it should come with fries. But the fries were an extra $5. After I ordered bacon on the burger as well it ended up costing me $30! A little pricey. But delicious. My friend ordered the cheddar eggs with home fries and sausage. It was also yummy!! Philip our server was sweet and informative!! Really liked this place. Ready to come back for more food!\"],\n",

Delivery always on time...pizza, all food nice fresh n right on point, Will recommend to everyone i know and wont complaint at all I ordered a pie from seamless over an hour ago. I called them and was told that they had left with my pie a while ago. The pie finally arrived and it was freezing cold!!! I called them back and the woman said \"Well, I don\\'t know what to tell you.\" Told me to call seamless to get my refund and hung up on me! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL!!! I truly wish I can give zero stars! This place used to be good the lady is so kind. However there\\'s this one older man behind the counter extremely rude. He makes it seem as if he\\'s doing you a favor for getting a slice ready. I ordered spaghetti a few weeks ago the sauce was sour and watery. A cheap place for bad and nasty pizza. I literally just paid $4 for crap... never ever will I come back. $4 for a SLICE WITH SOME VEGGIES ON IT IS WAY TOO MUCH! I been ordering all summer since Giovanni\\'s went out of business. The food is ok but there service sucks. We order are norm on a Friday night on GH and waited hours. So I called to ask what happened and a old man told me he canceled my order because they too busy. No one ever called me and my 2 little girls and wife we very hungry when I got home. Since you are so busy let me help you by never ordering again. Food ain\\'t really have any taste, and the chicken was over cooked. I order Coke and got Sprite plus they said 30 to 45 mins and showed up after 1.5 hours. I would rate them zero stars if possible. After waiting an hour for my delivery and calling because I did not receive it, the owner argued with me that I did and that his delivery man was right. The customer service is provided by the owners and they are disgusting people to interact with as a customer. No thank you. Stay the hell away from this place!!! Aside from the mediocre tasting pizza, the calzones suck (and I\\'m partly saying that because I found a hair in mine GROSS), The only redeemable thing were the buffalo wings but they were too few for the price. Poor Quality in food and sanitation. So do yourselves a favor and skip, avoid, do not enter this place!!! ABANDON ALL HOPE, ALL YE WHO ENTER! Hands down the worst pasta dishes my co-worker and I have ever had. Nothing hurts worse than receiving food so awful that you have no choice but the throw it in the trash where it belongs. Please for the love of god stay as far away from the pasta at all costs. I didn\\'t eat here and wouldn\\'t. The guy at the counter had a dirty white torn shirt on that showed off his midriff. It\\'s like Appalachia but dirtier. nice ghetto spot with large, greasy slices that are sure to ill you up and raise your artery clotting. Nevertheless, the place has been here forever and its kinda worth eating if you are low on cash and don\\'t want assorted great in a box from Kennedy\\'s or whatever the hell it is that Golden Krust claims they sell.'],\n",

Start your review of Little Caesars Pizza. Tbh the only pizza I order from Little Caesars is the Deep Deep dish Cheese. It takes me back to pizza hot. \\xa0Word of advice always check to make sure it's done or you going be like be home sticking it in the oven, or you going me eating doughy pizza. This is review is solely on customer service and the rude, disgusting attitude of one of the employees working at this particular location. I was not able to get the employees name, he was light skin w dark hair, assuming he was Latin. A women who came in to order pizza -didn't speak English so she ordered her pizza in Spanish which the douche employee understood. When the woman asked the total he answered her in English with a disgusting condescending attitude. What I should have done was report this douche to the Department of Health for not wearing his mask properly especially in a restaurant. The other workers (in the back putting the pizzas in the oven) are African American are always nice and were properly wearing their masks. I am only pointing out the AA workers bc they are always nice and kind to customers. And I don't want anyone to mistake who the douche bag employee is. While waiting for my pizza I observed the douche bag employee be rude to 2 others customers who placed an order. Disgusting behavior by an employee serving a mostly immigrant neighborhood. It takes nothing to be kind to someone especially when customers are spending their hard earned money. I have actually avoided going into the shop now when i see the douche bag employee. So if you see the douche bag -walk away or be ready to give attitude back. This store is robbing people. They are raising there own prices Store manager is very rude and disrespectful. The store is nasty. They are not cleaning the doors or handles. They are not following state law to keep us safe. None of them was wearing a mask!! This is a horrible place. I walked in and the staff was in the back listening to loud music. Finally after call them 3 times the manager walked to the front. He was horrible and rude. I don't even wana give this place 1 star lol. Will never come back here again. I dont understand why most of the time this place is run by 1 employee?!!! This place thrived when it opened in 2009 but in the past few years they have haired ppl with poor work ethics. You all know the type. This place Was great but how and i waiting 45mins for a supreme pizza becuase theres only one person here on a thursday afternoon when rush hour is about to begin. Smh. Rude and incompetent staff! They do not pay attention to details. They are not aware of their stock on which flavored wings they had available which caused a longer wait. Also tried to sell me bbq wings that I initially had no intentions on purchasing. The main cashier who works night's handled the situation very poorly and it wasn't the first time. \\xa0WORST LITTLE CEASARS IVE EVER BEEN TO!!!!THEY ALL SHOULD BE RETRAINED! Pizza in the Bronx for lunch was okay. \\xa0I spent the morning contemplating when suddenly a co-worker inquired about going for a short drive for pizza. \\xa0Despite never having Little Caesars as I am accustomed to local pizza shops, I came with an open mind. \\xa0Little Caesars is franchise and independently owned and operated. \\xa0The pizza taste fresh despite the appearance of mass produced. \\xa0It was not sliced all the way through as I have to pry it apart with my bear hands. \\xa0The portion was plentiful as I usually eat less for lunch. \\xa0We both ordered the lunch combo special of $5.00 each which includes one carbonated soft drink. \\xa0MEH, I never like soda or carbon hydrated drinks. \\xa0(Former NYC Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would be proud of my healthy non-sugary drink intake). \\xa0There were no substitute for bottled water or juice-- I can even stomach ginger ale, but none were an option. \\xa0The server was polite and courteous. \\xa0The interior enables minimal seating and is very worn, dark and dingy. \\xa0No restroom facilities on site. \\xa0Place your order to go and then RUN! Horrible service, the employees see you and dont serve you right away, cashier always has an attitude, they take extra long to make your order. The food itself is pretty darn good, but the wait time can be long because they seem to be short staffed. Sometimes I order at this location and there would be ONLY ONE employee manning the register AND cooking the food! I don't think I've seen more than 2 or 3 people working at this location at a time. Two other nearby Little Caesars have closed down because of poor service; hopefully things pick up for this location. $5.99+ fee $0 min 30-40 mins\"],\n",

Start your review of Rafaelina Restaurant Bar. I ordered delivery on a Wednesday night and it arrived quickly. It was pouring so I felt horrible but nonetheless, the service was great. The food wasn\\'t bad but I don\\'t think I would order again unless I didn\\'t have an option. I did get 10% off, so yay for that!Overall, great service but the food was mediocre. Ordered food from Grubhub at 3:25. It is now 6:49 and we still have not received it. I called the restaurant around just 5pm to complain and they didn\\'t even bother to apologize and was just told that my food was on its way. I called just now and was told the delivery person tried to deliver it to the wrong apt and that the order was then cancelled. Nobody called us to inform. Le deberian de dar verguenza dejar a la gente con hambre esperando por horas y sin darle una llamada. NEVER AGAIN.,, 3rd Time and NEVER AGAINI just ordered chicken chunk combo and \\xa0sprite.... got COKE (YUCK), the beans have no flavor and the chicken had all the breading off the skin and they were \\xa0not cooked fully only thing good was the flan ... 24.88 wasted and a 90 min wait for delivery If I could give this place a half star , I would . We ordered on grub hub @7:56pm , our food didn\\'t arrive until 9:32pm & it was cold . We had to reheat our food in the microwave. Throughout waiting we must\\'ve called twice or three times - on the last call the woman stared they was 5 minutes away , but they of course we\\'re not . So when the food got here , we called back to complain they were cold and the woman basically ignored us and didn\\'t care . We will never order here again . There should be a \"no stars\" option for awful restaurants like this one. Never order delivery from this restaurant. Delivery took over two hours and the woman who answered the phone was rude, the delivery driver didn\\'t have the decency to apologize. The food was cold upon arrival.Will be contacting management and will be telling my friends and family and everyone else to NOT order from this establishment. I\\'m normally not one to complain or even write reviews and for these people I wanted to make it known that I have never in my life been so unsatisfied with food and service.Highly advise against this restaurant. Don\\'t do delivery if you can\\'t actually deliver. We could have saved a lot of time by just going to pick it up ourselves. That wouldn\\'t have been a problem had they simply called and told us. I\\'ve only ever done take out so I can speak to that experience. We live in a 1-2 mile radius of the place. We\\'ve ordered 3 times from them and every time we did it was an over 2 hour wait. You might ask why we kept ordering from them if it was late, the first time the guy called saying he was lost. Ok. Fine. Second time it was a busy night at the restaurant, which you could hear over the phone. The third and final time nothing was wrong and they were over 2.5 hours late. The food is alright, I could get better elsewhere. The staff unfortunately does not know how to speak English very well and my Spanish is not fluent enough to leave a good complaint.Perhaps going to the restaurant is different. Who knows. But after my three experiences I will NEVER go back. i placed an order and i never got it! it was a simple breakfast order. It took an hour before i got a call from the delivery guuy who could not find my location. IT IS A HIGH RISE BUILDING THAT TAKES UP HALF OF THE BLOCK!!! i was on the phone with this man for 30 minutes giving him directions. he was clear across town! I called the restaurant and surprise! An answering machine picked up. I left a respectful, but annoyed message and did not even get callback.i will NEVER order from this place again. The food at this place is ok. Not sure about the location. I didn\\'t see many people dining. Most tables were empty. Is a better option for take out. Tell that useless c*** Rafealina that she can\\'t cook chicken. Because, she sucks. How do you call yourself a Spanish restaurant if you can\\'t cook Spanish food? Also tell her that her beans were tasteless. I had to use my imagination to taste them. I don\\'t know where you get your pork from, but that was the most limp pork chop I\\'ve ever seen. They\\'re pork CHOPS not pork CHIPS! It doesn\\'t take an hour to reheat some rice, unseasoned beans and premade food. Also if I\\'m a mile away I shouldn\\'t be waiting literally almost two hours for some mediocre scraps you decide to call a good portion of food. Don\\'t get me started on the delivery man, who parked like a block away and took his sweet damn time, like it was a chore! I paid 3.00 for a red bull. They forgot it and when we called the place they said they\\'d be on it. Five hours and one salty (but honest) review later here we are.Btw your maduros look like cat shit My first mistake was not heeding to the yelp reviews... The food was decent and affordable, however the delivery time was UNACCEPTABLE. I waited nearly 2 hours, and had to contact them periodically to ensure the food was still on its way. And I only live 1 mile away from the damn store... Needless to say my food was cold on arrival.'],\n",

New Wendy\\'s, same trash service!4 for $4\\'s that are 3 for $4\\'s, small fries having a grand total of five fries, missing patty on a Dave\\'s double...i missed this level of quality. The new building really does it a disservice. rudest customer service in a while. asked for sauces and informed us on \"policy changes\" that we have to pay for anything more than 2 sauces, didn\\'t even give us correct sauces after we already spent $22 there. just an overall bad experience. the wendy\\'s in maize is exceptionally better all around. I live literally within sight of this place and I won\\'t go back. Service is usually rude, slow and wrong. Just came home was overcharged and they forgot a drink. The food well...sucks. The hamburgers are tasteless - pickles are weird not quite dill and onions are huge slices not chopped. Plain bun no sesame seeds. The meat / cheese really have no flavor. The fries are bland, not crunchy or salty just kinda there. I am not a huge fast food person, so this review could be very bias. There was a good five minutes before they could take my order (five minutes of waiting in front of the intercom). The employees appeared testy too. It\\'s not like I am expecting five-star service ... I mean it\\'s Wendy\\'s \\u200d, but that was one-star service for me! What terrible service we received... absolutely WOULDNT reccomend going to this location staff is slow asked to repeat myself 2 times at speaker and then again at the window . Then proceded to wait 15 min for 1 sandwich and a 4 piece with only 1 car in front of me absolutely ridiculous This place has changed for the worse over the past few months. \\xa0The drive through lane is SO SLOW & service inside not much better. \\xa0I used to have the chicken/apple/salad often but now I\\'m looking for a new place. \\xa0Bring back a decent manager!!!!! Hello, today I went to Wendy\\'s. I use to love their delicious apple pecan salad after a nice workout. But this time, there were no pecans. This happened to me a few days prior at another Wendy\\'s location. The lady at the window called it the \"Full Apple\". This caught both my mother and I by surprise. We\\'re so used to having it called just an Apple Pecan salad and so yeah I guess that\\'s what they call it now. But then when I open my bag and found no pecans I was distraught. What was the point of an apple pecan salad without the pecans? Here\\'s the thing Wendy\\'s, I do not like anything else from your menu besides the salad. So get it together, put my pecans in the bag, so you don\\'t have to catch these hands. This place is insanely ridiculous...they didnt have enough meat for 2 jr. Cheeseburgers...their chocolate frost machine was broke or some stupid shit...on top of that i sat at the speaker for 15 minutes before i could even order then another 15 to get my food. They outta just close this miserable excuse for a restaraunt down and tear the building down. Every single time I come here, the soda is flat and tasteless. The fries are usually cold and soggy, or over salted. But I usually order a chicken sandwich and they\\'re usually pretty fresh and good.

They delivered the food in a reasonable amount of time, and the order was accurate. Basic requirements : fulfilled. This is worst drive thru ever rude and no customer service got a route 66 mixed with add ins n had a ketchup package in drink unopened talk about covid worry This place is terrible, they could at least heat their hamburgers up, the hamburger is cold the cheese is cold laying on it not even melted,the buns cold. The health department needs to check this place out that food is not even hot enough to meet their temperature standards. They didn\\'t just cook it, Or it would least be warm \\xa0it\\'s laying in there for no telling how long and it\\'s not being kept up to the temperature it should be. If I wanted cold food I\\'d start going back to Wendy\\'s Have you ever had a room temperature strawberry? Or maybe a hot lemonade? Delicious,right? Well i guess that\\'s exactly what i ordered from this sonic. I ordered a strawberry lemonade. If you couldn\\'t tell by the beginning it was the worst lemonade i\\'ve ever tasted. It was so bad that i let my whole family taste it...as a prank!! What a nightmare! Won\\'t ever order a strawberry lemonade again from anywhere. Just to avoid such a drink!! Thanks for the experience Sonic in Bonner Springs! Came here on a saturday to get ice cream for my kiddos. Was told they dont do ice cream. Megan, who was taking my order was very rude. Very helpful and courteous staff members, got my order correct and out in a timely fashion! Most likely one of the worst sonic\\'s in America. Slow service. Bad customer service. Weird hours. Other Sonics close later than 9pm. Not this one. Drive to the Basehor sonic. It\\'s much better. Pulled up and an older customer was yelling at the car hop.... I should have taken that as a sign. Maybe the SLOWEST, RUDEST Sonic in America. Took 25 minutes to get two regular cheeseburgers at 4pm in the afternoon. Then went they finally came out the manager had the audacity to have their car hop tell me to tell them about my coupon before they come out..... Even your 50 cent corn dogs on Halloween won\\'t inspire me to eat at this location again. I\\'ve been going to Sonics across the US for years and I\\'ve NEVER waited for more than 25 minutes without my order being delivered, so we asked what\\'s up. They said \"we\\'re backed up\" (no duh) and took another ten minutes to cancel the order. \\xa0After that it took even longer to canel the CC charge. HORRIBLE service - expectation management wehn we ordered (\"Just so you know, we\\'re a little busy right now\") would have done WONDERS! Stay far away from this place..... Rude people, slow service, and pretty sure they don\\'t actually listen to your order when you tell them. Not to mention the cooks are ALWAYS on smoke break on the west side of the building.']}"

       "\"424 E 9th St New York, NY 10009 Your trust is our top concern, so businesses can't pay to alter or remove their reviews. Learn more. Start your review of Thursday Kitchen. I LOVED this spot and would argue it's one of the best Korean fusion tapas I've had! We tried the edamame dumplings, steak, truffle mac & cheese, popcorn chicken, and cauliflower (in order of my favorites). They were all soo good but the edamame dumplings & steak stole the show! * Edamame dumplings- filled with a smooth & creamy edamame paste and topped with the perfect amount of truffle oil & Parmesan. So unique and delicious! My only complaint is I wish this plate came with more! We shared amongst 3 and got ~1 each* Steak- tender and cooked to perfection. Topped with a soy garlic glaze and coupled with grits-like feta cheese. Absolutely amazing * Truffle Mac & cheese - I loved that you can smell the truffle the minute they bring it by your table, they don't skimp on the truffle! This was delicious and creamy! (but definitely on the heavier side)* Korean popcorn chicken - pretty good and would have again (I love popcorn chicken), but nothing too special!* Cauliflower - spiced and seasoned, almost close to an Indian food-like flavoring. Good, but not amazing Overall, loved the food here! You can't go wrong with your choices. As our drink, we got the saki but I absolutely want to try the soju next time :)Also- great covid protocols. They took temps and our table was separated by curtains on each side (we sat inside). I recommend going early since they don't take reservations and there's always a wait! I'll start with saying their outdoor seating is a true accomplishment in the era of Covid and outdoor dining especially in this biting December weather. The menu options were mostly between inspired and creative. Despite the lag of more traditional dishes this Asian fusion please completely nailed it in terms of execution. Their edamame dumplings were almost as good as buddakan (almost but not quiet). The clear star of the show was the black truffle mac & cheese. The soft shell crab with the wasabi REmoulade was extremely well executed. I also love the broccoli Rob with the Korean chili oil but had a tough time picking between this and the brussels sprouts which were dragon flamed and I will hence be back for soon. The angry sweet potato came with a delicious and generous side of sririacha cheese which I almost wanted to save for the future. I was seduced by the plantain because of its unique pairing with Lebanese condiments such as Lebneh. I will also be back for the eel tacos next time since my stomach surprisingly could not fit another thing by the time dinner was done. The final crowning Jewel on top of the adorable Decour in the comfortably warm seating was the desert which was conveniently not too sweet or heavy. It is definitely becoming an East Village new \\xa0favoriteP.s. I will say the kimchi paella was a bit underwhelming and the portions are on the small side This NYC gem was just a magical birthday celebration evening. NYC opened indoor dining back up to 25% and as I write this, it is now at 35%. We cannot lose these places...this is what makes New York, New York. I hope that we can all get through this pandemic and keep these gems alive.As I was saying...You will not be disappointed at all! Every dish created by CHEF PROPRIETOR KAY HYUN & team was MAGICAL!The flavors, the combination, the textures. Beautiful tapas sized plates were shared amongst my group.It is an art and every bite should take you on a rollercoaster ride.My kids are 10 + 8 years old and I'm so grateful they were able to experience this journey through all the different plates. They loved it and had a better understanding of each one. Omg!! What a great meal from start to finish. I have been dying to try Thursday kitchen for the longest time. We came on a Sunday evening and were able to be seated immediately (IMO the best spot for outdoor dining). We decided to share as many dishes as we could and left feeling full and satisfied. We ordered: Edamame dumplings 8/10- overall flavor was delicious but texture a little mushy for my taste Steak 7/10- steak was a little tough but the flavors were excellent Truffle mac and cheese 10/10 *MUST ORDER* - everything you could ever want. That cheese pull though Kimchi paella 9/10 *MUST ORDER* - amazing mix of flavors and perfectly cooked seafood Gnocchi 6/10 - gnocchi had amazing texture but the sauce was a little too sweetDefinitely recommend checking Thursday Kitchen out for small but filling bites! Great place for catching up with friends or date night! We came on a Monday evening right when it opened. No wait and several tables remained available during the duration our dinner.Server suggested two dishes per person but we had more than that. The edamame dumplings were a standout. We've never had anything quite like it and they were cooked well. The batter that the soft shell crab was cooked in leaned sweet. It reminded me almost of the sweetness of funnel cake, which I personally enjoy. I just missed the actual flavor of the crab because all I could taste was the sweet batter. Kimchi paella was solid. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the lucky noodle dish but I enjoyed the chewiness of the torn noodles with the crispness of the vegetables. I can't handle a lot of spice and could easily eat both the kimchi paella and lucky noodles. Eel tacos were also made well, no complaints. Truffle mac and cheese was tasty. Steak was very flavorful and soft.I enjoyed trying yuzu beer for the first time as well. Worth checking out if the menu piques your interest. No high chairs were offered and there's no changing table in the restroom. Came to Thursday Kitchen this evening for my birthday since this is my favorite restaurant. \\xa0Yet another great meal here. This time we tried the soupy and spicy Korean chili pepper gnocchi. My boyfriend got the kimchi paella which he said was really good. I always get the lucky noodle and the Korean popcorn chicken. \\xa0We also enjoyed the lettuce jem salad. Really you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu at this place. The drinks and service were also excellent as always. \\xa0Can't wait to be back again al summer Great food and great service. Everything came out fast and the people that work there are really nice. We got the Korean popcorn chicken, lucky noodle, edamame dumplings and truffle Mac and cheese. My favorite were the lucky noodles. It was spicy but I prefer my food to be in the spicier side. The portions are meant to be small plate portions but they still are quite generous. Drinks are great as well. Can't wait to come back My friend and I went on a Monday night and it was very busy. Luckily we were able to get seated immediately around 6:30 PM. We got the tuna tartar, plantains, truffle mac n cheese, soft shell crab katsu, kimchi paella, and bread pudding topped with blueberries. The plantains were definitely our favorite but of course we forgot to take a picture... the tuna tartar and bread pudding were also at the top of our list. Everything else was also really good but a bit too filling since the mac n cheese and paella were just carbs. Overall, I would suggest getting 5-6 items for 2 people if you're pretty hungry. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the extremely long wait time because there's no reservation system- but the food is amazing! There are so many reviews for this restaurant and the hype is understandable. We came at 7pm on a Friday, where the wait was 2.5 hours for 4 people. Luckily, our friends lived nearby so we killed the time at their place. When finally seated, every dish that was brought on was astonishing. The only thing is I wish the portions were bigger! At first look, the pricing looks quite decent but the dishes, since it's tapas style, are quite small especially when shared. I'd recommend coming here with a small party. The standout was the truffle Mac and cheese and eel taco personally. Just the perfect amount of truffle drizzled on the creamy Mac and cheese leaves you wanting so much more! The eel taco is quite unique, and the guac adds a light twist to what might be a heavy bite. Be prepared to wait if you come, but also be prepared to have an unforgettable meal. Thursday Kitchen offers a unique menu of food and drinks in the setting of a warm and welcoming place. I came here on a, you guessed it, Thursday evening. We ordered the kimchi paella and truffle mac and cheese. If you're lactose intolerant, pack your pill because you're going to need it. These dishes were extra cheesy with the pull and all. True beauty. The flavors came through with each bite. I recommend these dishes. They are more filling than you think.The drinks come in plastic pouches. We got Lychee Reach Rich and Ruby the GF. Both delicious but do know that Ruby has rosé and not rose which I found out the fun way. The service here is wonderful. Our waitress was hilarious and made our dining experience memorable. Was brought to this incredible spot by a friend, and I cannot wait to go back ASAP! We lined up a few minutes before they opened at 5PM on a Saturday night, and there was already quite a crowd. We got seated shortly, and ordered drinks, and two family-style dishes to share. The Plantains were out of this world, and the Korean Popcorn Chicken was absolutely incredible. One of the best meals I've had in a long time with great service too!! Highly recommend.\""

COVID dining update -So happy to be able to return to my favorite spot for brunch! Amélie is still as delicious as I remembered.Indoor dining felt quite safe here. They had extremely high partitions between tables that were not spaced 6' apart (but otherwise social distancing was observed). Less than 25% of capacity was used indoors when we dined on Sat during brunch (outdoors was quite bustling).My husband and I shared our favorite menu items, including the chicken liver mousse (which was listed as a separate brunch special item - so don't be disappointed when you don't see it on the regular brunch menu online!), moules frites, and grilled octopus.

It\\'s an easy fallback because you can\\'t really go wrong with anything on the menu. I don\\'t usually go for the entrees, because I love sharing a bunch of small dishes among friends. My must-orders are the chicken liver mousse (super rich and creamy) and the moules frites. Their french fries are great and I love the dipping sauces! The mussel broth is also perfect for soaking up with bread. I also love the goat cheese ball, French onion soup, beef tartare... basically everything on the menu.

At first I was thinking how does a French restaurant with wine have so many reviews in NY, but Amelie did not disappoint. We ordered the lobster risotto, duck leg confit, octopus and escargot. Plenty of food for 4 people. The risotto was great in texture and had a fair amount of labor. The duck was cooked perfectly. Crispy skin on the outside and fall off the bone meat on the inside. The grilled octopus and escargot are a must order as well. We also had some wine flights which were priced very nicely during happy hour even on a Sunday. Love how they have happy hour even on',\n",

We had a single of the Hazelnut Maple Praline Pancake, a sausage egg and cheese sandwich with cheddar on a brioche bun. And lastly we got a fried chicken sandwich. *Hazelnut Maple Praline Pancake was so rich with flavors. There is a melted piece of butter on top and you get this slight sweet and savory bite as you eat it. The pancake itself is pretty thick so I would recommend sharing or a single really is enough. \\xa0**Sausage Egg and Cheese Sandwich was delicious and really huge! Look at the picture I took of the section. This thing is filling and worth your money. The melted cheddar was a nice tough. ***Fried Chicken Sandwich was our 2nd time getting it.

There's a limited number of these outdoor greenhouses that line the sidewalk (about 8-10 of them). They're basically as the name describes: individual greenhouses, with a picnic table, which seems like it could fit four comfortably. The seat was cushioned so yay for my butt.Sure, you can dine inside or you can dine in your own private COVID-19 safe space (or as close to it as you can get while being out in public). The door on my greenhouse kept getting stuck and I swore I was going to have to make fast friends with the waiter trying to pry it open. The day was fairly chilly but I felt comfortable inside the greenhouse even though the heat lamp above wasn't on. I'm sure it would be even nicer on a 70 degree day.

Not sure how much extra it was because I don't think I ever saw the itemized bill (or maybe I wasn't paying attention when I paid..oops). I've read other people complain about there not being enough avocado on the avocado toast. False: there is a good amount of both mashed and chunky avocado spread across the sourdough bread, which in and of itself was THICK and crusty and rustic. There was a lot of salad and hazelnuts/walnuts on top, lots of crunch and mess. This is definitely a fork and knife situation, not a pick up the avocado toast and feed it into your mouth situation. An avocado toast is essentially an avocado toast no matter how you dress it. I was just glad it was something that didn't come from my kitchen.I also ordered a latte ($6) which was nice (see: it didn't come from kitchen).

We got some pancakes to share - these things are no joke. I think it's a bit of a misnomer to call them pancakes, as they are so thick - more like big flat cake doughnuts.

I LOVED this spot and would argue it's one of the best Korean fusion tapas I've had! We tried the edamame dumplings, steak, truffle mac & cheese, popcorn chicken, and cauliflower (in order of my favorites). They were all soo good but the edamame dumplings & steak stole the show! * Edamame dumplings- filled with a smooth & creamy edamame paste and topped with the perfect amount of truffle oil & Parmesan. So unique and delicious! My only complaint is I wish this plate came with more! We shared amongst 3 and got ~1 each* Steak- tender and cooked to perfection. Topped with a soy garlic glaze and coupled with grits-like feta cheese. Absolutely amazing * Truffle Mac & cheese - I loved that you can smell the truffle the minute they bring it by your table, they don't skim\",\n",

Good, but not amazing Overall, loved the food here! You can't go wrong with your choices. As our drink, we got the saki but I absolutely want to try the soju next time :)Also- great covid protocols. They took temps and our table was separated by curtains on each side (we sat inside). I recommend going early since they don't take reservations and there's always a wait!

The soft shell crab with the wasabi REmoulade was extremely well executed. I also love the broccoli Rob with the Korean chili oil but had a tough time picking between this and the brussels sprouts which were dragon flamed and I will hence be back for soon. The angry sweet potato came with a delicious and generous side of sririacha cheese which I almost wanted to save for the future. I was seduced by the plantain because of its unique pairing with Lebanese condiments such as Lebneh. I will also be back for the eel tacos next time since my stomach surprisingly could not fit another thing by the time dinner was done.

It reminded me almost of the sweetness of funnel cake, which I personally enjoy. I just missed the actual flavor of the crab because all I could taste was the sweet batter. Kimchi paella was solid. My husband wasn't a huge fan of the lucky noodle dish but I enjoyed the chewiness of the torn noodles with the crispness of the vegetables. I can't handle a lot of spice and could easily eat both the kimchi paella and lucky noodles. Eel tacos were also made well, no complaints. Truffle mac and cheese was tasty.

We got the tuna tartar, plantains, truffle mac n cheese, soft shell crab katsu, kimchi paella, and bread pudding topped with blueberries. The plantains were definitely our favorite but of course we forgot to take a picture... the tuna tartar and bread pudding were also at the top of our list. Everything else was also really good but a bit too filling since the mac n cheese and paella were just carbs. Overall, I would suggest getting 5-6 items for 2 people if you're pretty hungry. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the extremely long wait time because there's no reservation system- but the food is amazing! There are so many reviews for this restaurant and the hype is understandable. We came at 7pm on a Friday, where the wait was 2.5 hours for 4 people. Lucki\",\n",

At first look, the pricing looks quite decent but the dishes, since it's tapas style, are quite small especially when shared. I'd recommend coming here with a small party. The standout was the truffle Mac and cheese and eel taco personally. Just the perfect amount of truffle drizzled on the creamy Mac and cheese leaves you wanting so much more! The eel taco is quite unique, and the guac adds a light twist to what might be a heavy bite. Be prepared to wait if you come, but also be prepared to have an unforgettable meal.
